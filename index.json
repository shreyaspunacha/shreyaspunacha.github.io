What we are curious about is the following question:\nHow will the heat distribution change over time?\nWe know that the heat tends to flow from the warmer region to the colder region. Therefore, we are trying to find an equation that describes this process. The phenomenon of heat flow can be modelled by a partial differential equation called the heat equation. The application of this equation is quite diverse. Both engineers and physicists use it to describe processes like heat flow, molecular diffusion, Brownian motion Etc.\nMathematically, the phenomenon of heat flow can be modelled using the following equation.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial{u}}{\\partial{t}} = D \\Bigg(\\frac{\\partial^2{u}}{\\partial{x^{2}}} + \\frac{\\partial^2{u}}{\\partial{y^{2}}}\\Bigg) $$\nWhere D is a constant called diffusion coefficient, characteristic of the material through which the heat flows and $u(x,y,t)$, is the unknown temperature function to be solved.\nWe need to know the initial and boundary conditions to obtain the unique solution of the heat equation or to apply any numerical method. The diffusion equation needs one initial condition at $t=0$; i.e $u(x,y,0) = I(x,y)$, where $I(x,y)$ is a given function. Besides the initial condition, boundary conditions are required at each point on the boundary.\nFinite Difference Explicit Method In this post, we will solve the heat equation numerically using the finite difference explicit method. Explicit means the solution at a given time step depends only on the previous time step, which is in contrast to the implicit method, where the solution also depends on the subsequent time step. The finite difference method provides an approximate numerical solution to the problem by discretizing the domain into grids. The temperature $u(x,y,t)$ is sought on each node of the grid.\nSuppose we seek the solution of $u(x,y,t)$ for a time interval $0 \u0026lt; t \u0026lt; T$ in a 2D domain having dimensions $[0,Lx]×[0,Ly]$, where $L_{x}$ and $L_{y}$ are the length of the domain along $x$ and $y$ directions. As a first step, we generate a mesh grid with discretization steps $dx$ and $dy$ in two spatial directions and $dt$ in time as follows;\n$0 = x_{0} \u0026lt; x_{1} ··· \u0026lt; x_{n_{x}} = L_{x}$ $0 = y_{0} \u0026lt; y_{1} ··· \u0026lt; y_{n_{y}} = L_{y}$.\nThe temporal domain $[0, T ]$ is discretized as,\n$0 = t_{0} \u0026lt; t_{1} ··· \u0026lt; t_{n_{t}} = T$.\nThe solution $u(x,y,t)$ is known only on the grid points $(x_{i},y_{j})$ with $i = 0,…,n_{x},$ and $j = 0,…,n_{y}$. We approximate the continuous function $u(x,y,t)$ by a discrete function $u^{n}_{i,j}$ on the grid. On the mesh, the discretized heat equation can be written as,\n$$ \\frac{\\partial{}}{\\partial{t}} u(x_{i},y_{j},t_{n}) = D \\Bigg(\\frac{\\partial^2{}}{\\partial{x^{2}}} + \\frac{\\partial^2{}}{\\partial{y^{2}}}\\Bigg) u(x_{i},y_{j},t_{n}) $$\nThe next step is to replace the derivatives with their finite difference approximations. It is done using the forward difference method in time and the central difference method in space:\n$$ \\frac{ u_{i,j}^{n+1} - u_{i,j}^{n} }{dt} = D \\Bigg( \\frac{u_{i+1,j}^{n} -2 u_{i,j}^{n} + u_{i-1,j}^{n}}{dx^{2}} + \\frac{u_{i,j+1}^{n} - 2 u_{i,j}^{n} + u^{n}_{i,j-1}}{dy^{2}} \\Bigg) $$\nNow we have converted the partial differential equations into algebraic equations, which makes them easy to solve. Solving for the unknown $u^{n+1}_{i, j}$:\n$$ u_{i,j}^{n+1} = u_{i,j}^{n} + \\frac{D dt}{dx^{2}} \\bigl( u_{i+1,j}^{n} - 2 u_{i,j}^{n} + u_{i-1,j}^{n} \\bigl) + \\frac{D dt}{dy^{2}} \\bigl( u_{i,j+1}^{n} - 2 u_{i,j}^{n} + u^{n}_{i,j-1} \\bigl) $$\nStability The finite difference explicit method is conditionally stable. We can show with Von Neumann Stability Analysis that we need the discretized time step $dt$ to satisfy the following condition.\n$$dt \u0026lt; \\frac{1}{2 D} \\frac{(dx dy)^2}{(dx)^2 +(dy)^2}$$\nConclusions The heat equation is of fundamental importance across scientific fields. The more general version of the heat equation, the diffusion equation, is used extensively in physical and biological sciences. In physics and statistics, the heat equation is related to the study of Brownian motion via the Fokker-Planck equation. In this post, we saw how the heat equation could be discretized into a set of algebraic equations on a mesh grid. In the next post, we solve these algebraic equations using the Python programming language.\n","date":1660314691,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660314691,"objectID":"4ffd7fee3b46cce25a1758436357cea7","permalink":"https://ShreyasPunacha.github.io/post/heat_equation/","publishdate":"2022-08-12T20:01:31+05:30","relpermalink":"/post/heat_equation/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction Suppose we have a square-shaped iron plate and know how the heat is distributed across the plate at a certain point in time.

In many physiological tissues, such rotating waves of activity are pathological, and in heart, it leads to cardiac rhythm disorders or even fatal conditions such as ventricular fibrillation. Thus in many situations, it is desirable to remove such spiral waves from the medium.\nHowever, in heterogeneous media, rotating spiral waves tend to move towards heterogeneities (henceforth called obstacles) in the medium and rotate around the boundary of the obstacle as if the wave is pinned to it. Unpinning a pinned wave requires a careful stimulus given close to the core of the pinned wave and within a short time interval known as the unpinning window of the spiral wave. One method of eliminating these spirals are by using multiple periodic field pulses. The idea here is to shoot multiple pulses at the rotating spiral and hope that one pulse falls into the unpinning window and eliminates the pinned spiral. However, there is a problem with this approach. If the unpinning window is quite narrow, the chances of pulses delivered falling into the unpinning window are very less. To circumvent the problem, we use circularly polarised electric fields instead of traditional dc field pulses.\nIn this project, we present a mechanism for unpinning the spiral waves using circularly polarised electric fields. We show that for a given obstacle size, there exists a time period of the CPEF below which spiral can always be unpinned. We call it the cut-off time period. We also show that the termination always happens within the first period of the CPEF. We derive a robust and generalised analytical formulation which explains the findings of the simulations. Our theory accurately predicts the cut-off time period of CPEF. In particular, we show that unpinning is always successful if the period of the CPEF is below the cut-off period. We also show that the cut-off period depends linearly on the radius of the obstacle. We find that there is no traditional unpinning window with the circularly polarised electric field.\n","date":1658902444,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658902444,"objectID":"a678cd9ecf7fb6fed14819df0b02cdd2","permalink":"https://ShreyasPunacha.github.io/project/unpinning-using-cpef/","publishdate":"2022-07-27T11:44:04+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/unpinning-using-cpef/","section":"project","summary":"Spiral waves have been found in a variety of human organs like the surface of the retina causing migraine, inside the brain fostering epilepsy and in the heart muscle leading to fatal cardiac arrhythmias.","tags":[],"title":"Unpinning Spiral Waves Using Circularly Polarised Electric Fields","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Rotating spiral waves are often associated with functional disorders in physiological tissue, like reentrant electrical activity in the heart during cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, it is essential to devise methods to eliminate them. But rotating waves in heterogeneous excitable media tend to attach to heterogeneities (or obstacles) and form stable pinned waves. These pinned waves have to be unpinned first to be able to eliminate them.\nThey can be unpinned if an electric stimulus is delivered very close to the pinning centre and within a specific time interval called the unpinning window, i.e., the stimulus has to be within a narrow spatial and temporal window.\nRecently, many groups have started using periodic field pulses to increase the chances of unpinning. The idea here is to fire multiple pulses at a rotating spiral and hope one pulse would fall into the unpinning window and eliminate the pinned spiral. Studies so far have focused on unpinning a rotating wave by secondary excitations emanating from the obstacle itself. However, these studies show that unpinning window is quite narrow compared to the experimental studies on the intact heart. So far, the larger width of the unpinning window in the intact heart is attributed to its 3D structure. However, we hypothesised that if an additional obstacle is put close to the existing obstacle, the collective width of their unpinning window must increase. This induced us to study the role of multiple wave emitting sites in the unpinning process. Also, multiple heterogeneities in close vicinity offer the possibility of additional stimulus sites and additional anchoring sites. In such cases, one needs to examine how the distribution of heterogeneities modifies the unpinning window. Despite their critical importance in low-energy anti-fibrillation techniques, this problem has not received much attention. We study how these additional obstacles can alter the unpinning of a single spiral.\nIn this project, we show that secondary excitations emanating from nearby heterogeneities can unpin a wave attached in the vicinity in monolayers of cardiac cells. We then undertake a detailed numerical study of the wave unpinning in the presence of two heterogeneities. We found that the unpinning window either increases or decreases in the presence of additional heterogeneity. Their influence depends on their orientation with respect to the electric field, distance from the obstacle, and size. Along certain orientations, unpinning completely fails.\nThe figure shows success and failure of unpinning of spiral pinned to an obstacle in the presence of the additional wave emitting site. Black vertical arrow on the right indicates the direction of applied electric field of strength $E_{0} = 1.2$ V/cm. (a) Spiral is pinned to an obstacle of radius 3 mm with second obstacle of radius 2 mm nearby. (b) Nucleation of secondary excitation by the application of short timed pulse.

As climate change is accelerating the frequency of wildfires around the planet, scientists are looking for better ways to predict and control them. The problem they are dealing with is surprisingly similar to the electrical signals that cause arrhythmias in the heart. So, what connects these raging wildfires across the world to the electrical signals in the heart?\nThe connection between the forest fire-front and the electrical signals that wreck havoc in the heart becomes apparent when we look at the mathematics of their wave propagation. Mathematically, both the media are classified as excitable media, and these waves are called excitation waves.\nExcitable media is made up of a large number of elements (or cells) distributed in space, each element of which possesses the property of excitability. The elements of the excitable medium interact with each other through diffusion-like coupling. The general properties of an excitable element are the following:\nEach element has a stable resting state. We can compare this condition to a fully grown and thriving forest. The cell has an excitation threshold. The cell can only be activated if the stimulus is above this threshold. For example, a tiny spark at some corner of the forest may not be able to sustain a fire. A certain amount of initial fire is required to start and maintain the fire. Each cell has a property of refractoriness. The cell takes a certain amount of time to be ready for a second stimulus following the first excitation. During this time interval, another stimulus, no matter how strong, will not be able to generate a second activation. This time interval is called the refractory period of the cell. Once the forest is totally burned down, the fire cannot sustain as no fuel is left to burn. To start a new fire, we must wait until the forest re-grows. The time taken to regrow the forest corresponds to the refractory period of the forest. Because excitable media take time to recover after a wave passes, two waves in such a system would annihilate each other instead of passing through each other like sound waves or water waves.\nIn the case of a forest fire, the refractory period can last for several months or even years. However, in certain biological and chemical media, the refractory period lasts only a few hundred milliseconds. Because of the short refractory period, they can exhibit complex pattern formation like rotating spiral waves. Examples of spiral waves in other forms of the excitable medium are shown in the figures above.\nFig (a) shows the spiral waves in an oscillating chemical medium called the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. Fig (b) shows the simulated spiral wave in a rabbit heart. Fig (c) shows multiple spiral waves in a starving colony of amoeba called Dictostellium Discodium. Fib (d) is a harmless condition called Geographic tongue where spiral waves form on the human tongue.\nCardiac Arrhythmia A heart muscle is made up of cells that contract and relax according to the electrical signals sent out by the natural pacemaker cells called the Siano-Atrial node. As the waves emitted by the SA node spread across the muscle, the heart beats and facilitates blood circulation throughout the body. A normal heart would beat about 60-100 times per minute.\nUnder certain conditions, the abnormalities in the heart can alter the shape of the waves emitted by the Siano-Atrial node and give rise to spiral waves. Since a spiral wave rotates with a much higher frequency and propagates differently from the normal pacemaker signal, it will result in the disruption of the normal blood pumping ability of the heart. This condition is called cardiac arrhythmia.\nTherefore, a better understanding of the dynamics of spiral waves may lead to safer and less invasive ways to treat different forms of arrhythmias. There are several methods of treating arrhythmias, such as drug therapy and defibrillation. We shall discuss these methods in detail in future posts.\n","date":1658399647,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658399647,"objectID":"25582ec8af36dd92e4bdc4faf27e0f50","permalink":"https://ShreyasPunacha.github.io/post/excitable_media/","publishdate":"2022-07-21T16:04:07+05:30","relpermalink":"/post/excitable_media/","section":"post","summary":"Every year wildfires consume thousands of hectares of forests worldwide, causing great devastation to wildlife and humankind.
